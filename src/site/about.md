* I have been leading and building socially-impactful fintech companies since 2010.
* I once took a traditional wooden boat building class and was extremely bad at it.
* I enjoy fishing and being out on the ocean. I have participated in several competitive big game fishing tournaments.
* I started an internet service provider for small businesses when I was 16 before moving to Silicon Valley to join a startup.
* I have a degree in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction.
