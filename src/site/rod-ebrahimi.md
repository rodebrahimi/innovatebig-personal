* I have been building socially-impactful fintech companies since 2010.
* I once took a traditional wooden boatbuilding class and quickly realized I was no good at it.
* I enjoy fishing, being out on the ocean, and eating seafood.
* I have participated in several competitive big game fishing tournaments.
* I started an internet service provider for small businesses when I was 16 in the early dot-com days.
* I participated in [Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com) in the Summer of 2010.
* I enjoy bringing together talented teams that go on to do measurably impactful work.
* I have a degree in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction.
