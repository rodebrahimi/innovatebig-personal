* I have been building socially-impactful fintech companies since 2010.

* I enjoy fishing, being near and out on the ocean, and eating seafood. I have also participated in several competitive big game fishing tournaments.
* I started an internet service provider for small businesses when I was 16 in the early dot-com days.
