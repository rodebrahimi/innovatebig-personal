For some time now we have seen a shift to more casual and fun business software. E-mail was probably the first example of a personal, social online tool that has now became the defacto standard for business communications with GMail it became even more fun to use. Another recent example is Slack. I think they helped do this with online chat and, for those who remember, IRC (internet relay chat). Slack's use of emojis, developer app ecosystem and its slick user onboarding are examples of what's to come in the world of enterprise software. Not surprisingly to me, Slack was actually founded originally as a gaming company called "Tiny Speck"!

It may be obvious to state but I will do it anyway: online consumer trends, especially those that are driving the latest generation of online gaming apps, will drive the next generation of enterprise business software. The world deserves business and enterprise software that's actually fun to use. I hope the future of work will be in part measured by how much fun every day business tools are to use.
