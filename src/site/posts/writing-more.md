Clear and concise writing is hard. The clearer your thinking the better your writing. At least this has been my own experience.

Starting this year I plan to write more. At least initially, writing will be for my own benefit and not necessarily written with a specific goal or audience in mind. I hope this will make it easier to build a regular writing habit where the objective is simply to write more often as opposed to gaining something beyond that.
