Clear and concise writing is hard. The clearer your thinking, the better your writing. This has been my experience with writing anyway.

Starting this year I plan to write more. Initially, I want to write without a specific goal or audience in mind. I hope this will make it easier to build a regular writing habit. The objective will simply be to write more often as opposed to gaining anything beyond that. Wish me luck.
